# ShopStop

ShopStop is an e-commerce platform built using React, Node.js, and MongoDB Atlas. 
This project showcases a full-stack implementation where React is used for the front-end, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface, 
Node.js is used for the back-end server, handling API requests and managing business logic, 
and MongoDB Atlas serves as the database, storing product information, user data, and orders.
